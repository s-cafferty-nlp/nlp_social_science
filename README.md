# NLP for Social Science

NLP tools are largely underutilized for the study of international relations. The projects in this portfolio demonstrate the potential for using NLP to map international politics with embassy Twitter data. Namely, by examining how embassies use different vocabulary to frame particular topics, we can determine rhetorical patterns that emerge.

In the image above, we see the contextual outliers in the U.S. Embassies' Twitter feeds.

Moreover, we can see the vocabulary associated with the United States' geopolitical adversaries such as China and Russia.

This project is meant to demonstrate the extent to which simple NLP tools can be used to evaluate rhetorical patterns. An excellent use case for this technology would be a dashboard that traces sentiment about particular countries or political figures over time.
